## Claude Code 2025 Best Practices

### Agent Framework Development
- Use "think" mode when designing complex object relationships or collection patterns
- Apply structured workflows: Research → Plan → Implement → Review for framework development
- Maintain single-responsibility principle for BaseObject and BaseCollection implementations

### AI-First Design Patterns
- Integrate seamlessly with @have/ai package for intelligent object behavior
- Leverage cross-package integration for comprehensive agent capabilities
- Design objects with AI interaction as a primary consideration, not an afterthought

### Context-Aware Development
- Use separate context windows when working on different framework components
- Maintain clear boundaries between object definition, collection management, and AI integration
- Focus on specific framework patterns without mixing concerns

## Foundational Libraries Integration
- **@langchain/community**: LangChain community integrations
- **cheerio**: HTML parsing for content processing
- **yaml**: YAML configuration and data serialization

## Package Dependencies Integration
- **@have/ai**: AI model interactions and completions
- **@have/files**: File system operations and content management
- **@have/pdf**: PDF processing and document analysis
- **@have/sql**: Database operations and schema management
- **@have/spider**: Web content extraction and processing
- **@have/utils**: Utility functions and type definitions

## Core Concepts

### Object-Relational Mapping
- Property-based schema generation
- Automatic database table creation and synchronization
- TypeScript to SQL type mapping
- Relationship management between objects

### AI-First Design
- Integration with multiple AI providers
- Context-aware AI interactions
- Streaming response handling
- AI-powered content analysis and summarization

### Collection Patterns
- CRUD operations with flexible querying
- Advanced filtering with multiple operators
- Pagination and sorting capabilities
- Bulk operations and batch processing

## Common Patterns

### Defining Custom Objects
```typescript
class Document extends BaseObject<any> {
  title: string = '';
  content: string = '';
  category: string = '';
  tags: string[] = [];
  
  constructor(options: any) {
    super(options);
    Object.assign(this, options);
  }
  
  async summarize() {
    return this.options.ai?.textCompletion(
      `Summarize: ${this.content.substring(0, 2000)}`
    );
  }
}
```

### Collection Management
```typescript
class DocumentCollection extends BaseCollection<Document> {
  static readonly _itemClass = Document;
  
  async findSimilar(docId: string) {
    const doc = await this.get(docId);
    return this.list({
      where: { category: doc.category },
      limit: 5
    });
  }
}
```

### Advanced Querying
```typescript
const results = await collection.list({
  where: {
    'created_at >': '2023-01-01',
    'status in': ['pending', 'active'],
    'title like': '%important%'
  },
  orderBy: ['priority DESC', 'created_at DESC'],
  limit: 20
});
```

## Best Practices

### Schema Design
- Initialize all properties with default values in constructors
- Use appropriate TypeScript types for proper SQL mapping
- Keep object schemas focused and cohesive
- Plan for schema evolution and migrations

### AI Integration
- Use appropriate AI models for different tasks
- Implement proper error handling for AI operations
- Cache AI responses when appropriate
- Design prompts for consistency and reliability

### Performance Optimization
- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Error Handling
- Handle database connection failures gracefully
- Implement retry logic for AI API calls
- Validate data before database operations
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

## Framework Architecture

### Initialization Flow
1. Database client setup and connection
2. AI client configuration and authentication
3. Schema synchronization and table creation
4. Collection initialization and dependency injection

### Data Flow Patterns
- Request → Collection → Database/AI → Response
- Automatic schema generation from class properties
- Lazy loading of related objects and dependencies
- Event-driven updates and notifications

### Integration Points
- File system operations for content storage
- Web scraping for data collection
- PDF processing for document analysis
- Vector search for similarity matching

## Advanced Features

### Schema Synchronization
```typescript
// Automatic table creation from object properties
await collection.initialize(); // Creates tables, indexes, triggers
```

### Relationship Management
```typescript
// Define relationships between objects
class User extends BaseObject<any> {
  async getDocuments() {
    return this.related(DocumentCollection, 'user_id');
  }
}
```

### Bulk Operations
```typescript
// Efficient batch processing
await collection.bulkCreate(documents);
await collection.bulkUpdate(updates);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Schema Issues
- Property not persisted: Check constructor initialization
- Type mapping errors: Verify TypeScript to SQL type compatibility
- Migration failures: Review schema changes and dependencies

### AI Integration Problems
- API failures: Implement proper retry and fallback mechanisms
- Response quality: Improve prompt engineering and model selection
- Rate limiting: Implement proper throttling and queue management

### Performance Bottlenecks
- Slow queries: Add appropriate database indexes
- Memory issues: Implement streaming and pagination
- AI latency: Use caching and async processing

### Database Connectivity
- Connection failures: Check database configuration and availability
- Transaction conflicts: Implement proper isolation and retry logic
- Schema synchronization: Verify permissions and database state

## Development Workflows

### Testing Strategies
- Unit tests for individual objects and methods
- Integration tests for collection operations
- Mock AI responses for consistent testing
- Database transaction rollback for test isolation

### Debugging Techniques
- Enable SQL query logging for database debugging
- Log AI interactions for prompt optimization
- Use database explain plans for query optimization
- Monitor resource usage and performance metrics

### Deployment Considerations
- Database migration strategies
- AI API key management and rotation
- Resource limits and scaling policies
- Error monitoring and alerting
