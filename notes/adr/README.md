# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the HAppy VErtical SDK project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- Track the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Understand the trade-offs considered
- Provide historical context for future decisions
- Facilitate knowledge sharing across the team
- Support onboarding of new team members

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:

- **Introduce new dependencies** (libraries, frameworks, services)
- **Change system architecture** (monolith to microservices, database changes)
- **Affect multiple packages** in the monorepo
- **Impact performance, security, or scalability**
- **Establish coding standards or conventions**
- **Choose between multiple technical approaches**
- **Retire or replace existing technologies**

## ADR Process

1. **Identify the Decision**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs to be made
2. **Research Options**: Investigate different approaches and their trade-offs
3. **Create ADR**: Use the provided template to document the decision
4. **Review**: Get feedback from team members before finalizing
5. **Implement**: Proceed with the implementation
6. **Update**: Modify the ADR if circumstances change

## ADR Naming Convention

ADRs should be named with the format:
```
NNNN-title-of-decision.md
```

Where:
- `NNNN` is a 4-digit sequential number (0001, 0002, etc.)
- `title-of-decision` is a short, descriptive title in kebab-case

Examples:
- `0001-use-typescript-for-all-packages.md`
- `0002-adopt-biome-for-linting-and-formatting.md`
- `0003-implement-monorepo-with-pnpm-workspaces.md`

## Review Process

Before merging an ADR:

1. **Technical Review**: Ensure the technical analysis is sound
2. **Stakeholder Input**: Get feedback from affected team members
3. **Documentation Review**: Verify the ADR follows the template
4. **Impact Assessment**: Consider consequences and alternatives
5. **Approval**: Get sign-off from technical leads

## Updating ADRs

ADRs represent point-in-time decisions. If circumstances change:

1. **Don't modify the original ADR** - it represents historical context
2. **Create a new ADR** that supersedes the previous one
3. **Reference the original ADR** in the new one
4. **Update the status** of the original ADR to "Superseded"

## Integration with Definition of Done

Per the [Definition of Done](../workflow/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md), an ADR must be created when:

> An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) has been created in the `/docs/adr` directory if the change introduces a new dependency or makes a significant architectural decision.

This ensures architectural decisions are properly documented and reviewed as part of the development process.

## Template

Use the [ADR template](template.md) to create new ADRs. The template provides a consistent structure for documenting decisions.
