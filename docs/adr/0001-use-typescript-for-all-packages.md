# ADR-0001: Use TypeScript for All Packages

## Status

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2024-01-01
- **Authors**: HAppy VErtical Development Team
- **Reviewers**: Technical Leadership

## Context

### Background
The HAppy VErtical SDK is a monorepo designed for building vertical AI agents. As the project grows, we need to establish a consistent programming language and type system across all packages to ensure maintainability, developer experience, and code quality.

### Constraints
- Need to support both CommonJS and ESM modules
- Must maintain compatibility with Node.js runtime
- Development team has strong TypeScript experience
- Build process must be efficient for monorepo structure

### Assumptions
- TypeScript will continue to be actively maintained
- The benefits of static typing outweigh the compilation overhead
- Team members are proficient in TypeScript development

## Decision

We will use TypeScript exclusively for all packages in the HAppy VErtical SDK monorepo, with a pure TypeScript implementation to avoid CommonJS vs ESM compatibility issues.

## Rationale

### Options Considered

1. **Pure TypeScript**: All packages written in TypeScript
2. **Mixed JavaScript/TypeScript**: Some packages in JS, some in TS
3. **Pure JavaScript**: All packages in JavaScript with JSDoc typing

### Analysis

#### Option 1: Pure TypeScript
**Pros:**
- Strong static typing improves code quality and catches errors early
- Excellent IDE support with autocompletion and refactoring
- Better maintainability for complex codebases
- Consistent developer experience across all packages
- Built-in support for modern JavaScript features

**Cons:**
- Compilation step adds build complexity
- Potential learning curve for JavaScript-only developers
- Additional tooling configuration required

**Trade-offs:**
- Compilation overhead vs. runtime error prevention
- Initial setup complexity vs. long-term maintainability

#### Option 2: Mixed JavaScript/TypeScript
**Pros:**
- Flexibility to choose appropriate tool for each package
- Gradual migration path possible

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent developer experience
- Complex build configuration
- Potential type safety gaps at package boundaries
- Increased maintenance burden

**Trade-offs:**
- Flexibility vs. consistency and simplicity

#### Option 3: Pure JavaScript
**Pros:**
- No compilation step required
- Simpler build process
- Direct execution in Node.js

**Cons:**
- Lack of static typing leads to runtime errors
- Limited IDE support for large codebases
- JSDoc typing is less robust than TypeScript
- Harder to maintain as codebase grows

**Trade-offs:**
- Simplicity vs. type safety and tooling support

### Decision Criteria
- **Type Safety**: Ability to catch errors at compile time
- **Developer Experience**: IDE support, autocompletion, refactoring
- **Maintainability**: Long-term code quality and team productivity
- **Consistency**: Uniform approach across all packages
- **Ecosystem**: Compatibility with Node.js and npm ecosystem

### Selected Option
We selected **Pure TypeScript** because:
- Static typing significantly improves code quality for a complex monorepo
- Consistent developer experience across all packages
- Excellent tooling support enhances productivity
- The compilation overhead is acceptable given the benefits
- TypeScript's ESM support aligns with our module strategy

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Improved code quality through static type checking
- Better developer experience with IDE support
- Reduced runtime errors and debugging time
- Consistent codebase structure across all packages
- Enhanced refactoring capabilities
- Better documentation through type annotations

### Negative Consequences
- Additional build step required for all packages
- Potential learning curve for JavaScript-only developers
- Increased complexity in build configuration
- TypeScript compiler dependency

### Neutral Consequences
- Need to establish TypeScript configuration standards
- Must maintain tsconfig.json files for each package
- Documentation must reflect TypeScript usage patterns

## Implementation

### Action Items
- [x] Create root tsconfig.json with shared configuration
- [x] Configure individual package tsconfig.json files
- [x] Set up build process for TypeScript compilation
- [x] Establish linting rules for TypeScript
- [x] Update documentation to reflect TypeScript usage
- [x] Configure IDE settings for TypeScript development

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Initial TypeScript configuration and build setup
- **Phase 2**: Package-by-package TypeScript adoption
- **Phase 3**: Documentation updates and team training

### Success Metrics
- **Code Quality**: Reduction in runtime type errors
- **Developer Productivity**: Faster development cycles with better IDE support
- **Maintainability**: Easier refactoring and code navigation
- **Build Performance**: Acceptable compilation times for development workflow

### Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Build performance issues | Medium | Medium | Optimize tsconfig, use incremental compilation |
| Team learning curve | Low | Low | Provide TypeScript training and documentation |
| Configuration complexity | Medium | Low | Standardize tsconfig patterns, document best practices |

## Notes

This decision establishes TypeScript as the foundation for all future development in the HAppy VErtical SDK. All new packages must use TypeScript, and existing JavaScript code should be migrated to TypeScript as part of regular maintenance.
