# Welcome to SMRT Framework

Welcome to the SMRT Agent Framework documentation site! We're excited to share this powerful toolkit for building vertical AI agents in TypeScript.

## What is SMRT?

SMRT (Smart Agent Runtime and Toolkit) is a comprehensive framework designed to help developers build powerful, focused AI agents. Unlike general-purpose AI assistants, SMRT helps you create agents that excel in specific domains.

## Key Features

- **ðŸŽ¯ Vertical Focus**: Build agents specialized for specific use cases
- **ðŸ“¦ Modular Architecture**: Use only what you need
- **ðŸ”„ Auto-Generation**: Decorator-driven code generation
- **ðŸ”— Full Integration**: API, CLI, MCP, and client generation

Happy building! ðŸš€
