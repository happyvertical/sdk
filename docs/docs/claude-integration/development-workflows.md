# Development Workflows with Claude Integration

This guide demonstrates practical development workflows using Claude Desktop with the SMRT MCP server. These patterns help you build AI-powered applications more efficiently.

## Getting Started Workflows

### 1. New Project Setup

**Step 1: Initialize Project**
> "I want to create a new project using the SMRT framework for a task management application."

Claude will use the `new-smrt-project` prompt to guide you through:
- Project structure setup
- Dependency configuration
- Database initialization
- Environment setup

**Step 2: Create Core Objects**
> "Create a Task object with title, description, priority, status, due date, and assigned user."

Claude generates a complete SMRT object with:
```typescript
@smrt({
  api: { exclude: ['delete'] },
  cli: true,
  mcp: { include: ['list', 'get', 'create', 'update'] }
})
export class Task extends BaseObject {
  title = text({ required: true, maxLength: 200 });
  description = text({ maxLength: 1000 });
  priority = integer({ min: 1, max: 5, default: 3 });
  status = text({ default: 'todo' });
  dueDate = datetime();
  assignedUserId = foreignKey(User);
  // ... additional fields and methods
}
```

**Step 3: Add Intelligence**
> "Add AI methods to analyze task complexity and suggest completion time."

Claude adds AI-powered methods for intelligent task management.

### 2. Existing Project Integration

**Step 1: Assessment**
> "I have an existing TypeScript class for managing products. How can I migrate it to SMRT?"

Provide your existing code, and Claude will:
- Analyze current structure
- Suggest migration strategy
- Identify enhancement opportunities

**Step 2: Migration**
> "Migrate this existing Product class to SMRT framework while preserving all functionality."

Claude uses the `migrate-to-smrt` prompt to:
- Convert properties to SMRT fields
- Add proper decorators
- Preserve business logic
- Add AI enhancements
