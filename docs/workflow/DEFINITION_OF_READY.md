# Definition of Ready

## Overview

An issue is considered "Ready" when it contains sufficient information and context for a developer to begin work without significant clarification or discovery. This definition ensures efficient development and reduces context switching.

The Definition of Ready is checked when transitioning issues from "To Do" to "Developing" status, serving as a quality gate before development begins.

## Criteria

### 1. User Story / Problem Statement
- [ ] Clear description of the problem being solved or feature being added
- [ ] User story follows format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" (for features)
- [ ] For bugs: Steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior are documented

### 2. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for the issue to be considered complete
- [ ] Written in clear, testable language
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are considered
- [ ] Performance requirements specified (if applicable)

### 3. Implementation Gameplan
- [ ] Detailed plan of what code changes will be made
- [ ] Specific files/modules to be modified or created are identified
- [ ] Major architectural decisions and patterns are documented
- [ ] Integration points with existing code are clear
- [ ] Dependencies on other issues or external systems are identified
- [ ] Breaking changes or migration requirements are noted
- [ ] Potential risks or implementation considerations are acknowledged

### 4. Design Assets (if applicable)
- [ ] UI mockups or wireframes provided for frontend changes
- [ ] API contracts defined for backend changes
- [ ] Database schema changes documented

### 5. Estimation
- [ ] Relative complexity estimated (e.g., story points, t-shirt sizes)
- [ ] Time estimate provided if using time-based planning

### 6. No Blockers
- [ ] All dependencies are resolved or have clear timelines
- [ ] Required permissions or access are available
- [ ] Prerequisite issues are completed or in progress

### 7. Testing Considerations
- [ ] Test scenarios outlined
- [ ] Test data requirements identified
- [ ] Integration test requirements specified

## Examples

### Good Acceptance Criteria
 "When a user clicks the 'Export' button, a CSV file containing all visible table data should download with columns matching the table headers"

### Poor Acceptance Criteria
L "Add export functionality"

### Good Bug Report
 
```
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to /dashboard
2. Click on "Add Widget"
3. Select "Chart" type
4. Click "Save" without entering a name

Expected: Validation error appears
Actual: Application crashes with 500 error
```

### Poor Bug Report
L "Dashboard is broken"

## Workflow Integration

The Definition of Ready is applied when transitioning issues from "Todo" to "In Progress" status in the GitHub Project board. This ensures that:

1. **Todo items can be rougher** - Allowing for faster triage and prioritization without full refinement
2. **Just-in-time validation** - Readiness is verified only when development is about to begin
3. **Reduced waste** - Effort is not spent refining items that may never be worked on
4. **Fresh context** - Requirements and implementation gameplan are validated at the point of implementation

If an issue fails the Definition of Ready check, it remains in "Todo" status with feedback on what needs to be addressed before development can begin.
